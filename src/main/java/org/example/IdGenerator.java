// This class defines an unique ID generator which can be used
// to generate ID values (of type int).  The class maintains an int variable
// 'nextId' that stores the next available number that can be used as an id.
//  It is simply incremented each time therefore providing unique numbers.
//  It persists the next ID, by saving it to a text file, and updates the text file
//  with the new nextId every time a new ID is allocated.
//
// The intention is that this generator would be used by Vehicle, Passenger and
// Booking classes when they need to generate a new id field value
//
// This class creates a Singleton object-
// meaning that there can only be ONE instance of this class created.
//
// The file "next-id-store.txt" is be seeded with an initial id number (e.g. 101)
// so, that number will be the first id allocated.  Note that there is no meaning to the
// ids being allocated - and you should not assume that they give any sequencing
// information about the objects.  They are simply unique numbers (ids).
//
// This work is usually done by the DBMS
// The write-to-file each time approach may be inefficient,
// but it is easy to understand.
